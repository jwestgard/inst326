## Welcome

This website is an Open Educational Resource (OER) for my course on Python Programming offered through the [College of Information Studies](https://ischool.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland College Park](https://umd.edu). It is still a work in progress as the course materials and activities are being migrated from a traditional learning management platform to this website.

The course is divided into 11 [modules](modules) covering various topics in programming with Python, designed for undergraduate students majoring in Information Science. The modules are organized into three main units:

1. Fundamentals
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Working with Data
