1. Write a program that will let you enter in a word or sentence in lower case 
   and will print it out with the first letter capitalized. Hint, all 
   strings have a method **capitalize**, see if you can use it.

2. Write a program that will let you enter a sentence and will print each word
   out separately with the first letter capitalized. Hint: use the string's
   **split** function together with what you know about **for loops** and
   **lists**.

3. **Extra Credit**: Download the energy.py file from the Files area of ELMS
   site and modify it to report the states with the largest wind and solar
   generation.
