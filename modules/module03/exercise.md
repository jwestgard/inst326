1. Write a program that will let you enter in a word or sentence in lower case 
   and will print it out with the first letter capitalized. Hint, all 
   strings have a method **capitalize**, see if you can use it.

2. Write a program that will let you enter a sentence and will print each word
   out separately. Hint: use the string's **split** function together with what
   you know about **for loops** and **lists**.
