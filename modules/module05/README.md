## Topics

Module 5 introduces a useful toolkit for all sorts of text processing, parsing, and searching. Regular Expressions, or regex, is a language for defining patterns of text that can be used to find one or more matches in a target string. Libraries exist for working with regular expressions in the context of many different programming environments, including in Python (the 're' module).

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students should understand:

- The basics of writing regular expressions.
- How to test regexes using sites such as [Regex 101](https://regex101.com).
- How to use regexes in Python programs through the re module.
- The main functions for applying regexes in Python: search(), match(), and findall().
