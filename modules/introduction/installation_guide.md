# Installation Guide

Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming. In the following weeks you are going to: 
1. review the basics of procedural programming,
1. explore data manipulation with Python, and 
1. learn about object-oriented program design. 

But first you have to get some basic things out of the way.

You need to set up Python, the language we will be using, and an editing environment (either a text editor or an IDE).  If you are new to programming, it is recommended that you start with the IDE PyCharm, which is an application specifically for editing and running Python code. It is an environment built to help you create your own projects. It provides a number of tools to make your life easier, including a text editor with automatic code completion, easy indenting, and syntax-based coloring. It also includes a debugger, source code control, and much much more.

Keep in mind this is a collaborative class and not a competition. Feel free to help your fellow students get their programming environments up and running.

## Windows 
Your computer probably has dozens of applications and systems of various kinds on it, but Windows doesn’t come with the one we need – Python. So, we’re going to have to get it.

Download Python: We are using Python 3.5 or later in this class. To start, download the current latest version of Python 3 from https://www.continuum.io (Links to an external site.). This is the package you need to install Python. Once the download finishes, install it as you normally would any other application.

Install Python: The first thing of note will be a window asking for you to “Select Destination Directory”. Generally it will suggest Python3.5. That’s fine. Next will be a window “Customize Python 3.5.3” or whatever version you are installing. It’s best to leave this bit alone.

Downloading Pycharm: Like most applications you can just go to the Pycharm website and download Pycharm. Go to http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/index.html and click the big green button that says "Download Community".  The next thing of note will be this window which allows you to change various options, including what colors are used in the editor. Pick whatever you like (or just leave the defaults alone for now) and come back whenever you want to fine tune it.

Install a text editor: Sublime Text 3 is one good choice. It can be downloaded here: https://www.sublimetext.com/3 (Links to an external site.). 

## Mac 

For those of you with Macs, it can be a little confusing because Python 2 .7 is already installed. For this course, you need to use Python 3.5 or later.

Download Python: To start, download the current latest version of Python 3 from https://www.continuum.io/ (Links to an external site.). I recommend you use the graphical installer. Once the download finishes, install it as you normally would any other application.

Install PyCharm: Follow essentially the same instructions described above in the "Windows" section.

Install a text editor: Sublime Text 3 is one good choice. It can be downloaded here: https://www.sublimetext.com/3 (Links to an external site.). Another option is BBEdit, available in a free version here: https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/ (Links to an external site.).
