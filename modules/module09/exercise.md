The data in this CSV file energy.csv (uploaded to ELMS in Files / Module 8)
should look familiar to you, it's the data that we were working with in module
4. Remember how we had to iterate through the file to determine the largest
wind and solar producing state?

This time the CSV has been cleaned up a bit by removing the total rows which we
had to ignore the last time. We're going to use it as a way of explore why SQL,
databases and Python are useful tools to use together.

1. create a program that can read in the CSV data and load it into a database
2. query the database to see what the maximum solar and wind producers are
3. determine the total solar and wind production in the US by year
