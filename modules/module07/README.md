## Topics

This module will cover two important Object-Oriented _patterns_, "inheritance" and "composition". Inheritance is a way to make objects share functionality by relating them to one another in something like a parent-child relationship.  Composition, on the other hand, is a pattern for making objects relate to one another by a process of containment. A good example of this might be a "book" object being made up of "page" objects.
