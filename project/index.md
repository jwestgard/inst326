title: INST326 Final Project

In the last month of class we will work on a project (either on your own, or in groups of up to three) in which you will brainstorm, plan, 
document and complete a Python program that performs some useful and non-trivial 
task. You may choose to create a program that relates to topics or materials covered
in INST326, or another one of your classes, or you may choose to do something entirely new.

### Ideas

A large part of our work this semester has been focused on writing programs that work with data
in various formats (JSON, CSV), in databases (sqlite) and on the web (APIs), while using object-oriented programming techniques to model data and behavior.
Just as we did in the ProPublica exercise you may want to think about how you can
load, query and analyze data from various publicly available sources. Here are 
two resources that may help you generate some ideas for what you can do in your project.

* [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) is a weekly email 
  newsletter from [Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://twitter.com/jsvine) on the subject
  of publicly available useful/interesting datasets. IN each episode Jeremy
  describes a handful of datasets, including information about who created it,
  how much data it contains, what format it is in, how the data is useful, 
  and where to find it. They can be CSV files, spreadsheets, images, maps, and
  downloadable databases of all kinds. Browse the [archive](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive) of past newsletters
  or take a look at the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit) he has created for 
  all the datasets he has covered. See if you can find a dataaset that
  might be interesting to use in your project.

* [Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#readme) is a list of publicly 
  available web APIs curated on GitHub by [Todd Motto](https://twitter.com/toddmotto). 
  The APIs are listed by category (music, news, games, books, sports, weather, animals, etc) 
  and indicates whether you need to authenticate, whether it uses a secure connection,
  and a link to the documentation. You could use what we learned about using the
  requests module to obtain data from one of the APIs, or even create a "mashup" of 
  two or more.

### Deliverables

The purpose/goals of your project application are entirely up to you,
but in order to fulfill the requirements of the assignment, you should do the
following:

* Create a repository on GitHub where your code and documentation can live and be available to others.
* Create a README file that documents what the program does, and how it should be used.
* Create one or more Python files that make up your application.
* Create unit tests for developing your code and verifying that it works.

### Evaluation

The final project is worth 15 points (15% of your final grade). You will be graded on the following:

* Concept/Idea (5 pts): interestingness, novelty, utility, audacity, conciseness.
* Execution (5 pts): ability to run the program & tests, use of modules, classes, and code style.
* Presentation (5 pts): clarity of documentation, oral presentation, slides, etc.
